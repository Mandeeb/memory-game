Memory Game

Instructions:
  This game is similar to concentration.  To start the game click on any two
  cards to see if they match.  The game is over once all the cards are matched.  

Features:
  Move Counter - Each time you click on a card one move is added to the move
                 counter.

  Star Rating - When the game starts there are three stars.  As moves are made
                the star count goes down.  If there are more than 28 moves the
                star count goes down to two.  If there are more than 38 stars
                the star count goes down to one.  Forty eight or more moves
                and the star count is zero.

  Timer - A timer starts when the first card is clicked.  See if you can beat
          the timer.  Good luck!
